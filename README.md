# United Stated Border Patrol Sector Profiles

The Sector Profiles the US Border Patrol is [released for each Fiscal Year](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/media-resources/stats?title=Border+Patrol) containing statistics releated to border staffing, apprehensions, and seizures.

This repository was created to update the statistics for the [Border Wall project](https://border.inewsource.org/) at San Diego non-profit news organization [inewsource.org](https://inewsource.org/).

The current workflow scrapes the first table in each fiscal year's PDF and specifically focuses on the apprehensions and agent staffing at the southern border.
